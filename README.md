Hey Jane Tech Team!

To get things started,
Make sure you have Ruby version `'3.1.2'` installed on your local machine
After Ruby version `'3.1.2'` is installed, run the command:

```
bundle install
```

After running **bundle install**, you should be good to go start the application.
Run this command to start the application:

```
ruby challenge.rb
```

After running this command, it will generate a file named `'julians_output.txt'` from parsing the `'sample-input.txt'` file.
The program is complete after this process.

## Running Test

To the run the test suite for the program, run the command:

```
ruby test.rb
```

You don't have to run the **bundle exec rspec** command. The test suite will automatically run because
`'rspec/autorun'` is being required by the test file.
